                        Our most recent song, Deja Vu was recorded in the span of 2 days in February 2023.
                        Lots of mixing and re-recording vocals went into getting to the product that it is now, thanks to Ethan.
                        Take a listen:

                        Recorded at the end of 2022 and mixed at the start of 2023, Outta Luck, written by Ethan and Cameron is one we are proud about.
                        Lots of vocal layering and guitar tracks, Ethan spent an endless amount of hours mixing this piece.
                        It shows off the heavier sounds that we can bring... Take a listen!

                        Recorded in one night, Boyd and Ethan were messing around and came up with a little indie demo that has yet to be titled.
                        The song is still a work in progress, but it will be updated as we add to it!
                        Take a little sneak peek!

                        One of the songs that has a special spot in our hearts, Hurts My Head, was recorded in late 2021.
                        In our live shows, we take this song and combine it with one of our other songs, Killer Smile (video in the performances section)
