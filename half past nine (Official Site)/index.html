            <p>
                <div>half past nine is a 4-piece band formed in 2018 from Sydney, Nova Scotia.</div>
                <div>First know as Jester, half past nine changed their band name in 2023, as we felt it better suits our group.</div>
                <div>First friends then bandmates, we came together bonding over our wide variety in music tastes.</div>
                <div>From indie-pop to thrash-metal, our tastes vary greatly, but that's what we think helps develop our sound.</div>
                <div>Our sound can change song to song, sounds ranging from indie-rock to more mellow bedroom-pop.</div>
